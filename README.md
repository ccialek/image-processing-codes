# image-processing-codes
Collection of codes I've deveoped and used in lab for imaging processing



The Stasevich lab uses ImageJ/FIJI freeware to run our home-built microscopes. 
Additionally, either TrackMate (plugin for ImageJ) or Mathematica homemade particle tracking codes 
are used for image analysis. 

I have created a set of post processing codes to do little things... 
like process the images after image acquestion. 

Since we use freeware, we need to manually (or via Macro) process the images before they can be analyzed. 

This folder contains clean-up microscioy imaging codes I commonly use in lab.
