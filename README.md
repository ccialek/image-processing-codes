# image-processing-codes
Collection of codes I've deveoped and used in lab for imaging processing and analysis.
Type: Mathematica, ImageJ/FIJI (Java) 

The Stasevich lab uses ImageJ/FIJI freeware to run our home-built microscopes. 
Additionally, either TrackMate (plugin for ImageJ) or Mathematica homemade particle tracking codes 
are used for image analysis. 

I have created a set of post processing codes to do things like process the images after image acquestion 
or make masks. 

Since we run our microscopes on freeware, we need to manually (or via Macro automation) process the 
images before they can be analyzed. 

This folder contains microscopy imaging codes I've developed and used in my research.

# -Cropping spots from a set of image coordinates
# -Correcting mixed up image channels based on total intensity
# -Graphing number of particles over time
# -Shifting mask over time
# -Image post-processing
